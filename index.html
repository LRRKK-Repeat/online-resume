    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I've been learning how to become a full stack web developer, 
        by taking online courses, like 
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> 
        and now I'm taking Dr. Angela Yu's course: 
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete Web Dev Bootcamp</a>, 
        which I'm currently finding great success with.
    </p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I was never originally planning on working in web development at all 
        while at school, college and university, and thus my education is 
        mostly in Music, as I have been a drummer/musician from 13 years old.
        After experiencing some physical health issues that limit my ability
        to maintain a healthy career as a musician, I turned to coding as it's
        something that I have been interested in from an early age, ever since
        my friend gave me a book on HTML when I was merely 14 years old, back
        in 2007. I used this book as a guide to make my very own wesbite and
        loved the sense of pride that I felt in having made my own, something 
        that I had previously considered to be akin to magic. With that in mind,
        here's my Education:

            </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
        As a working, self-employed, musician, I often had quieter periods 
        where I would work a <em>normal</em> job, as an employee. This means 
        that I have quite a lot of space between jobs and it's not as 
        consistent as you might expect to see from other applicants. Please 
        note that I was working for myself in these gaps, and usually during 
        my employment also.
